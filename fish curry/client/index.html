        width="500" height="300" style="border:5px solid burlywood">
        <ul>
        <li>Fish maradine</li>
        <li>Ground spices</li>

        <li>Carom Seeds (ajwain): Often used in Desi Fish recipes to give depth and floral flavor and mask 
            any “fishy” smell. I didn’t want to make this optional because my mother-in-law always asks for
            this first when making this dish. </li>

        <li>Lemon: A white fish marinade essential. Brightens up flavors and masks any smell.</li>
        <li>Neutral oil: I use avocado or grapeseed. </li>

        <li>Yellow onions</li>

         <li>Garlic + ginger: Also used liberally. A heavy dose of aromatics is key in this fish curry. </li>
         
         <li>Coriander and cumin powder</li>
        
         <li>Tomatoes</li>

         <li>chilli powder</li>

         <li>pepper</li>

         <li>green chilli</li>

         <li>cilantro</li>

     <ol>
        <li>Toss fish with spices: Combine spices & salt and coat the fish as evenly as possible.</li>
        <li>Brown onions: This is a traditional, slow-burn curry with a proper onion sauté, where the 
            onions turn almost paste-like. 
            The onions must be fried with care here. If darkquickly, lower heat and/or deglaze with 1-2 tbsp of water.</li>
        <li>Add aromatics & spices: Once the onions are a beautiful golden brown, add the garlic & ginger 
            and sauté until aromatic. 
            Sprinkle in the spices and allow them to bloom in the hot oil,adding a splash of water if they threaten to burn.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes: Sauté out the moisture from the tomatoes until it forms a cohesive masala.
            Add water and allow it to simmer while you turn your attention to the fish.</li>
        <li>Pan-fry fish: An extra step, yes, but much worth it. 
            I have tried adding the fish in directly, but it carries less flavor while releasing moisture in the curry. Plus, the fish pieces are 
            more likely to break and disintegrate into the curry.</li>
        <li>Add fish to curry: The water will have reduced at this point. Reducing the curry down after
            adding water enhances flavor while making it more cohesive. 
            Once you’ve reduced, feel free to add as much or as little water as you’d like to increase curry.</li>
        <li>Garnish: This garnish at the end is essential to round out the curry and brighten an 
            otherwise rich dish</li>
